     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (sniem-leader-set-key
        "d" 'sniem-digit-argument-or-fn
        "D" 'dired)
       (sniem-set-leader-key ",")

   - Modes

     Sniem has 3 modes.
     - ~NORMAL~: This mode is the default mode for the editing buffers.

       | SPC | Execute function in motion-hint          |
       | /   | Reverse the direction of object-catch    |
       | p   | Add, change or delete the pair of region |
       | <   | Jump to prev comment mark                |
       | >   | Jump to next comment mark                |
       | m   | Insert new comment mark                  |
** Some special operations
   - Motions
